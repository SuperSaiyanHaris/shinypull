      {
        q: 'What is ShinyPull?',
        a: 'ShinyPull tracks public statistics for content creators and artists across YouTube, TikTok, Twitch, Kick, Bluesky, and Music (via Last.fm). We collect subscriber counts, follower counts, listener counts, view totals, and more every day, then present the data as charts and historical trends. Think of it as a stats tracker for the creator economy.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Is ShinyPull free?',
        a: 'Yes, the core features are completely free. Anyone can search creators, view their stats, browse rankings, and compare up to two creators at once without an account. Paid plans (Sub and Mod) unlock higher limits and extra features like CSV export, longer history, and more comparison slots.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What is the Trending page?',
        a: 'The Trending page shows the fastest growing creators on each platform over the last 30 days. Each platform uses the metric that best reflects real growth: view count growth for YouTube (since subscriber counts are rounded by policy), follower growth for TikTok and Bluesky, hours watched growth for Twitch, and paid subscriber growth for Kick.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What makes ShinyPull different from other stats trackers?',
        a: 'ShinyPull pulls data directly from official platform APIs where available. Charts are interactive, the layout is built for modern screens, and we track streaming-specific metrics like hours watched that most tools ignore.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Do I need an account to use ShinyPull?',
        a: 'No. You can browse freely without signing up. An account lets you follow creators, get a personalized dashboard, and save reports.',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: 'Data',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'How often is data updated?',
        a: 'Creator stats are collected multiple times per day. YouTube, Twitch, Kick, Bluesky, and Music (Last.fm) run on an automated schedule three times daily. TikTok profiles refresh four times daily. Stream monitoring for Twitch and Kick runs every three hours to track live viewership.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Is the data accurate?',
        a: 'We pull directly from official platform APIs and public data. One known limitation: YouTube has rounded subscriber counts to three significant figures since 2019 (so 1,234,567 would show as 1,230,000). This is a YouTube policy, not a ShinyPull issue. All other platform data is as precise as the platform provides.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Where does the data come from?',
        a: 'All data is publicly available. We use the YouTube Data API, Twitch Helix API, Kick API, Bluesky AT Protocol API, and Last.fm API for those platforms. For TikTok, we collect publicly available profile statistics. We never access private account information.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Why does my favorite creator not show up?',
        a: "We add creators over time. If a creator isn't in our database yet, you can request them on the search page. TikTok creator requests are processed automatically within 24 hours. For other platforms, search directly by username and their profile will be added automatically.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I trust the historical data?',
        a: "Yes. We store real snapshots taken at the time of collection. We don't backfill or estimate past data. If a creator was added to ShinyPull recently, their history only goes back to when we first tracked them.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: 'Platform-Specific',
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Why do YouTube subscriber changes always show as 0?",
        a: "YouTube rounds subscriber counts for all channels over 1,000 subscribers. Daily changes on large channels are smaller than the rounding threshold, so the displayed change appears as 0. The actual growth is real, it just can't be seen from subscriber counts alone. We default to showing view growth for YouTube because views are not rounded.",
      },
      {
        q: 'What does Kick show for follower counts?',
        a: "Kick's public API does not expose free follower counts. The number shown on Kick profiles is the paid subscriber count, not total followers. This is a Kick API limitation.",
      },
      {
        q: 'What are Hours Watched on Twitch and Kick?',
        a: "Hours Watched is the standard metric for streaming platforms. It's calculated from live viewership data collected every few minutes during streams, multiplied by stream duration. It shows total audience engagement better than follower counts alone.",
      },
      {
        q: 'What does Bluesky track?',
        a: 'We track follower count and post count for Bluesky accounts. Bluesky does not have profile-level view counts, so we only show the metrics the platform provides.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What does Music track?',
        a: 'The Music platform is powered by Last.fm data. We track monthly listeners (how many unique listeners an artist had in the last 30 days) and total play count (cumulative scrobbles across all Last.fm users). Artist genre tags are also shown. Last.fm deprecated artist profile images in 2019, so we show a fallback icon instead.',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: 'Account',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'How do I add a creator to ShinyPull?',
        a: 'Search for the creator by username on our search page. For YouTube, Twitch, Kick, and Bluesky, the profile is fetched and added automatically when you search. For TikTok, you can submit a request if no result is found, and it will be processed within 24 hours.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How do I follow a creator?',
        a: 'Click the Follow button on any creator profile page. Free accounts can follow up to 5 creators. Paid plans raise that limit.',
