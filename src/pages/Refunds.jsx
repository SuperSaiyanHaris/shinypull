                  All purchases on ShinyPull are final. We do not offer refunds on monthly subscription
                  charges, partial billing periods, or renewals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By subscribing, you acknowledge that you are purchasing access to a digital service
                  that is made available immediately upon payment.

              <Section title="Cancellations">
                <p>
                  You can cancel your subscription at any time from your Account page. When you cancel,
                  your plan stays active until the end of the current billing period. You won't be
                  charged again after that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cancelling mid-cycle does not entitle you to a refund for the remaining days. Your
                  access continues until the period you already paid for ends.
