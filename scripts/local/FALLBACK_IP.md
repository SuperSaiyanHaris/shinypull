## Using Mobile Hotspot as Fallback IP

If your home IP gets rate-limited by Instagram, you can use your phone's hotspot:

### Quick Setup:
1. Enable mobile hotspot on your phone
2. Connect your computer to the hotspot
3. Run the Instagram scripts manually
4. You now have a completely different IP (mobile network)

### Why This Works:
- Mobile IPs rotate frequently
- Mobile networks have high trust scores with Instagram
- Instagram can't block entire mobile networks (too many real users)

### When to Use:
- Only if your home IP gets 429 errors
- Run scripts manually via hotspot
- After 24-48 hours, switch back to home WiFi (block usually lifted)

### Cost:
- Uses ~5-10MB of data per run
- Very minimal data usage
